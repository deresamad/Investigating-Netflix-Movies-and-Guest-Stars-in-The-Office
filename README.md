# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-using-python

##  Introduction
This project is an exhibition of my skills in using Python for Data analysis to manipulate and gather insights from data.
The data used in this project is provided by **Data Camp** as a capstone project for my intoduction to python course. The python codes were run in jupyter notebook.

Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the 
largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021.
Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, 
it is a perfect opportunity to flex data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry

##  Problem statement
My friend has  been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, 
he has been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining.
As evidence of this, they have provided me with the following information. 
For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively.
